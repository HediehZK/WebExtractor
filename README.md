# WebExtractor
A WebExtractor which extracts the content of an input URL and returns the type of the web page.

For now, the types are restricted and contain 3 categories: "Article", "Product" and "Other".

Machine Learning aproaches might be helpful, but for this limited domain, I decided to use robust Rule-Based approach.
